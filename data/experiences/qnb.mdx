# Intern Experience at Qatar National Bank

My internship at Qatar National Bank was not only professionally enriching but also culturally rewarding. I had the chance to interact with colleagues from diverse backgrounds, gaining insights into various perspectives and technologies used in different parts of the world.

One aspect that stood out to me was the meticulous attention given to security throughout the software development lifecycle. We actively participated in ensuring that all deployment processes adhered to stringent security standards. This involved implementing secure configurations, conducting vulnerability assessments, and integrating security tools into our CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Responsibilities
- Collaborating with senior engineers to streamline continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins
- Conducting tests and troubleshooting issues in both development and production environments to ensure seamless software delivery.
- Reviewed user stories for the AGILE framework
