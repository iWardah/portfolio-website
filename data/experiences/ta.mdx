# Teaching Assistant Experience at University of Toronto 

I got the opportunity to facilitate learning in the following courses:
- [CSC236: Theory of Computation](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc236h1)
- [CSC263: Data Structures & Algorithms](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc263h1)

As someone who has always taken a liking for academia, teaching course content to students and being able to foster academic growth is a very fulfilling experience. These courses are also fundamental to the Computer Science curriculum, so my experience as a Teaching Assistant significantly enhanced my understanding of these concepts. Moreover, it provided me with the opportunity to adeptly communicate complex ideas and solutions which is something that I have found quite beneficial for my technical interviews!

## Key Responsibilities 
- Led tutorials of 30+ students, reinforcing lecture through problems and Q&A sessions
- Assisted in the creation of course content, ensuring alignment with educational objectives and accessibility standards to cater to diverse learning needs.
- Conducted grading and provided constructive feedback to students
