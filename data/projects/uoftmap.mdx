The UTSG campus is known for its enormous capacity which spans across downtown Toronto. Navigating through the campus is often frustrating for students, especially foreign to the city. Hence, the interactive map includes features such as direction to a destination, narrator, exquisite search bar with search auto-completion, ability to filter food places based on dietary restrictions and more. The user will be able to gain easy access to this information through navigating a visual representation of the UTSG campus in the form of a dynamic map and are permitted to interact with it o find more precise building description.
